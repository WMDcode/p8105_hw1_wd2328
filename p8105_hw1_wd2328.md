# Problem 1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")
```

The data set, `early_january_weather`, is a data-frame of hourly
meteorological data taken from LGA, JFK, and EWR airports during January
1-15, 2013 and consists of 358 rows and 15 columns. Recorded data
includes origin, year, month, day, hour, temperature and dew-point in F,
relative humidity, wind direction (degrees), speed and gust speed (mph),
precipitation (inches), pressure (millibars), visibility (miles), and a
time record in POSIXct format. The mean temperature is 39.5821229 F.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

From this plot, it can be seen that temperature fluctuates in cycles
with the day, generally increasing during day and decreasing at night.
Also, there was a gradual increase in mean temperature from the start of
the month to the middle of the month. Humidity also increases and is
higher in the middle of the month, leading to the conclusion that
humidity may be associated with higher temperatures.

# Problem 2

``` r
pr2_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  more_than_ten = sample > 10,
  char_vec = c("this", "is", "my", "character", "vector", "of", "length", "ten", "for", "problem2"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("level1", "level1", "level1", "level2", "level2", "level2", "level3", "level3", "level3", "level3"))
)
```

Trying to take the mean of each variable in the data-frame gives us:

`sample`: -0.1330083  
`more_than_ten`: 0  
`char_vec`: NA  
`factor_vec`: NA

Expectedly, the `sample` variable works as intended and returns a value.
Unexpectedly, `more_than_ten`, a variable consisting of TRUE/FALSE also
returns a value. This is because TRUE is given a value of 1 and FALSE is
given a value of 0. If the mean returns 0, like in this case, all values
must be FALSE, meaning none of our sample values are greater than 10.
The `char_vec` and `factor_vec` both return NA since the mean can not be
evaluated for character and factor variables.

``` r
as.numeric(pr2_df$more_than_ten)
as.numeric(pr2_df$char_vec)
as.numeric(pr2_df$factor_vec)
```

When converting these variables to numeric, elements in the logical
vector, `more_than_ten`, become either 1 or 0, based on their TRUE/FALSE
counterpart. As mentioned earlier, this is why the mean of
`more_than_ten` is 0. The elements in the character vector, `char_vec`,
become “NA”. The elements of the factor vector, `factor_vec`, become
either 1, 2, or 3. Since there were three factor “levels”, the factors
are just numbered 1-3.
