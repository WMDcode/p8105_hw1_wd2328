# Problem 1

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")
```

The data set, `early_january_weather`, is a data-frame of hourly meteorological data taken from LGA, JFK, and EWR airports during the month of January 2013 and consists of `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. Recorded data includes origin, year, month, day, hour, temperature and dew-point in F, relative humidity, wind direction (degrees), speed and gust speed (mph), precipitation (inches), pressure (millibars), visibility (miles), and a time record in POSIXct format. The mean temperature is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)` F.

```{r}
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```
